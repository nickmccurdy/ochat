A simple and open source web chat room.

## Goals
- Free and open source.
- Simple and easy to use.
- Easy to self-host, while also providing a hosted version.
- Do not require accounts by default.
- Support multiple chat rooms.

## Credits
- Inspired by [Campfire](https://campfirenow.com/) and [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/). Please note that I am not affiliated with either product, though I do enjoy using them.
- Loosely based on [Chat](https://github.com/djrenren/nodecrash/tree/master/Chat) from [John Renner](https://github.com/djrenren)'s [nodecrash](https://github.com/djrenren/nodecrash) repository.
