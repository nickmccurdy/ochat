A simple and open source web chat room.

Loosely based on [Chat](https://github.com/djrenren/nodecrash/tree/master/Chat) from [John Renner](https://github.com/djrenren)'s [nodecrash](https://github.com/djrenren/nodecrash) repository.

## Goals
- Free and open source.
- Simple and easy to use.
- Easy to self-host, while also providing a hosted version.
- Do not require accounts by default.
- Support multiple chat rooms.
